# What is this?
A script so I can use my dam foot pedal because linux software is lacking

# Notes:
- Dont forget to `sudo apt install xinput xdotool evtest`

xinput - stops the system from processing the input
xdotool - for doing key commands like ctrl+r
evtest - lists the system inputs in /dev/input
